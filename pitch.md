1. Final inspiration statement: Students who are in college and at least 18 years old who need a way to deal with financial uncertainty because they value money.  

2. We thought of a budgeting website where income and expenses will be tracked. A focus of stocks is included, so the user can start investing and knowing when to invest based on the recent news of stocks. The user can track when money comes in and goes out. The focus on the budgeting app can be different things, such as optimal food. Another idea is a website for suggesting side hustles. 

3. The final app idea is the budgeting app with a focus on stocks. We decided it should track income and expenses by using a similar feature to a blog, where the user can write what each income and expense is about. Possibly adding tags to each input. Then there will be a sidebar with information on stocks, so the user knows the optimal time to buy: if it is now, or later.
