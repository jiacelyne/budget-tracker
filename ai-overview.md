Asking the ai what would be the most usefull additions from the Alpha Vanta API to add into the app. It gave a 
better understanding of the API. 

Asking the ai to help with css with formating, implementing the tags, solving issues when saving the information to firebase.
It help make sure I had all the details for the CSS to make sure we liked how it looked and made sure everything was working.
It helped work out the errors and understanding what it meant. It helped find the litle things that was hard to find specificaly as the code got longer.
