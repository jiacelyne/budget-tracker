### Audience and Needs
The audience is anyone looking into investing apart of their income into stocks. They're interested in making money and building up a profile overtime. Therefore, their needs would include an income and expense tracker to know what money to allocate where and when. Different categorical tags can help organize budgeting. With stocks on the side, it keeps the user mindful of high and low points that compares it against the past 2 days.
